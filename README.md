SkillSwap is a free skill exchange platform where people can teach and learn from each other without money. It connects users with complementary skills, enabling mutual learning, community building, and knowledge sharing.
This project was generated using Create and spline.


This project is exclusively made for NextAI Hack (Students Only) (Open-Ended) hosted on devpost.

My idea behind this project is totally aligned with the idea of growing as a community.
You know how to play the violin!? well, i know how to code
How about we teach each other our skills for free and progress as individuals.

This is a next Js project built on react and tailwind. 
3d model and environment is done using spline 3d model. 
The project uses AI like the prerequistes of the Hackathon demanded.

Let's Win, as individuals, as a society, as Humans.

A video showing the features of the project can be viewed on this Youtube video - https://youtu.be/9DazB3RLBoE
the video only gives a walkaround tour for the webapp, since the UI is very self explanatory and easy to use.

I have desgined the UI in such a way that it can be used easily by 9 year old or a 90 year old alike. 

with that, thank you so much for presenting me with this oppurtunity. joined yoru discord and awaiting updates.
can't wait to hear from you, your feedback would mean the world to me.
